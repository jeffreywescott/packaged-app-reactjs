# Contributing

Here's how we'd like you to contribute.

Fork and clone the repo, then create a branch:

    $ git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/packaged-app-reactjs.git
    $ git checkout -b my-branch-name

Create your `.env` file for your environment, e.g.:

    $ echo -e "PORT=8083\nNODE_ENV=development"

Push to your branch and [submit a pull request][pr].

Someone else will review your code and merge the PR.
